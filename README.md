This FiveM adaptation was made with the use of EmmyLua and IntelliJ IDEA. Natives in EmmyDoc format were generated to help ease the programming experience. Note that only around 60% (rough estimation) of the original Chaos Mod effects are adapted. The 40% are mostly not here due to replication issues, being impossible to make through only server code (i.e. memory patching), or simply because I didn't have time.

The EnumerateX methods are from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/IllidanS4/9865ed17f60576425369fc1da70259b2). DisplayMessage displays a notification in the bottom left of the screen. ScaleformMessage is the SHOW_SHARD_RANKUP_MP_MESSAGE process.

# Code Disclaimer
I never used Lua nor modded FiveM until less than a month ago. This project was done in around five days. The code is:
- unoptimised
- ugly
- not reliably replicated
- likely to crash

The commit messages are also undescriptive.
